● [00:01]. Introduction to the Cylindrical Shells Method
     ◉ Main idea: Calculate the volume of a solid of revolution around the 𝑦-axis, bounded by vertical lines 𝒜 and ℬ and a function 𝒇(𝒙)
     ◉ Alternative to the disk/washer method: The disk/washer method would require two integrals; cylindrical shells aim to solve it with a single integral
     ◉ Visualization: The region is considered a function of 𝒙 rotated around the 𝑦-axis
     ◉ Cake analogy: The method is explained using the analogy of slicing a cake into concentric cylindrical layers with a "coffee cutter"
     ◉ Idea of limits: The thickness of each cylinder tends to be very, very small     

● [02:53]. Volume of a Cylinder
     ◉ Volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height
     ◉ The cross-section is a circle (or a washer), obtained by subtracting a smaller circle from a larger one
     ◉ Cross-sectional area: π𝓡₁² - π𝓡₂², where 𝓡₁ and 𝓡₂ are the outer and inner radii
     ◉ The height is the function 𝒇(𝒙)
          ○ An arbitrary point is chosen to determine the height

● [06:52]. Mathematical Development of the Formula
     ◉ Volume = Cross-sectional area × height
     ◉ Factoring out π: π(𝓡₁² - 𝓡₂²) × 𝒉
     ◉ Difference of squares: π(𝓡₁ + 𝓡₂)(𝓡₁ - 𝓡₂) × 𝒉
     ◉ Multiplication by 2/2 → 2∙1/2: 2π ⋅ (1/2) ⋅ (𝓡₁ + 𝓡₂) ⋅ (𝓡₁ - 𝓡₂) ⋅ 𝒉
     ◉ Identification of terms:
          ○ 𝒉 = height.
          ○ 𝓡₁ - 𝓡₂ = thickness of the cylindrical shell
          ○ (1/2)(𝓡₁ + 𝓡₂) = average radius
     ◉ [11:40]. General formula: 
          ○ **Volume = 2π × average radius × height × thickness**

● [13:00]. Connection with the Function 𝒇(𝒙) and the Differential and the Differential .png)
     ◉ A cylindrical slice is taken within the shell at an arbitrary point 𝒙ₖ*
          ○ [15:30]. 𝒙ₖ* is chosen as the midpoint of the interval.
               ■ 𝒙ₖ* is the average point between  𝒙ₖ₋₁ and 𝒙ₖ
     ◉ [16:24]. The thickness of the slice is Δ𝒙 (the difference between the previous and current slices).
     ◉ The height at 𝒙ₖ* is 𝒇(𝒙ₖ*)
     ◉ [18:20]. Volume of an individual shell: 2π ⋅ 𝒙ₖ* ⋅ 𝒇(𝒙ₖ*) ⋅ Δ𝒙
          ○ 2π ⋅          𝒙ₖ*             ⋅  𝒇(𝒙ₖ*)  ⋅      Δ𝒙
             2π × average radius × height × thickness
     ◉ [20:00]. The volumes of all shells are summed to approximate the total volume.
          ○ 𝓥 =  ∑ (from k = 1 to n)  2π ⋅ 𝒙ₖ* ⋅ 𝒇(𝒙ₖ*) ⋅ Δ𝒙
     ◉ The limit is taken as the number of shells approaches infinity, converting the sum into an integral.
          ○ 𝓥 =  lim_(n → ∞) ∑ (from k = 1 to n)  2π ⋅ 𝒙ₖ* ⋅ 𝒇(𝒙ₖ*) ⋅ Δ𝒙
     ◉ Final formula:
          ○ **𝓥 = ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 2π⋅𝒙⋅𝒇(𝒙)⋅d𝒙**
               ■ Ramdom arbitrary points 𝒙ₖ* are reoresented by 𝒙
               ■ Arround 𝒚-axis
     ◉ NOTE: Axis of revolution: Around the 𝒚-axis, integration is performed with respect to 𝒙
          ○ **Important!** When rotating around the 𝒙-axis, the function must be in terms of 𝒙
               ■ 𝓥 = ∫[𝒸,𝒹] 2π⋅𝒚⋅𝒇(𝒚)⋅d𝒚
               ■ Arround 𝒙-axis

● [24:35]. 🧩 Example – : Region bounded by 𝒇(𝒙) = √𝒙, 𝒙 = 1, 𝒙 = 4, revolved around the 𝒚-axis = √𝒙, 𝒙 = 1, 𝒙 = 4, revolved around the 𝒚-axis.png)
     ◉ Confirmation of the function in terms of 𝒙
     ◉ Integral setup: Volume = ∫[1,4] 2π𝒙 √𝒙⋅d𝒙
     ◉ Simplification: 2π ∫[1,4] 𝒙³ᐟ²⋅d𝒙
     ◉ Integration: 2π ⋅ [2/5⋅𝒙⁵ᐟ²)] | [1,4]
     ◉ Evaluating limits: (4π/5) ⋅ (4⁵ᐟ² - 1⁵ᐟ²)
     ◉ Final result: 𝓥 = (124π)/5

● [29:03]. Comparison with Disks/Washers and Functions Between Curves 
     ◉ The cylindrical shells method is an alternative to the disk/washer method, but it has a key difference:
          ○ Orientation of slices:
               ■ Disks/washers: slices ⟂ to axis of rotation.
               ■ Shells: slices ∥ to axis of rotation → thin strips wrap into cylinders.
     ◉ Wrapping around the 𝒚-axis
          ○ Use vertical strips (width 𝒅𝒙).
          ○ Radius = 𝒙
          ○ Height = [𝒇_upper(𝒙) − 𝒇_lower(𝒙)]
          ○ Thickness = 𝒅𝒙
     ◉ Wrapping around the 𝒙-axis
          ○ Use horizontal strips (width 𝒅𝒚).
          ○ Radius = 𝒚
          ○ Height = [𝒇_right(𝒚) − 𝒇_left(𝒚)]
          ○ Thickness = 𝒅𝒚
     ◉ Regions bounded by two curves
          ○ If the region is between two functions, height = upper − lower, similar to areas.
     ◉ Integration limits (𝓪, 𝓫)
          ○ Determined by intersection points of the two functions in 𝒙.
     ◉ General cylindrical shell formula
          ○ 𝓥 = ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 2π·(radius)·(height)·𝒅𝒙
          ○ For rotation about the 𝒚-axis: 𝓥 = ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 2π·𝒙·[𝒇_upper(𝒙)−𝒇_lower(𝒙)]·𝒅𝒙
          ○ For rotation about the 𝒙-axis: 𝓥 = ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 2π·𝒚·[𝒇_right(𝒚) − 𝒇_left(𝒚)]·𝒅𝒚
     ◉ Identifying the “top” function
          ○ Always check which curve is above (larger 𝑦) in the interval to set up the height correctly.


● [29:50]. 🧩 Example – cylindrical shells method: Region bounded by 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙 and 𝓰(𝒙) = 𝒙², around the 𝒚-axis = 𝒙 and 𝓰(𝒙) = 𝒙², around the 𝒚-axis .png)
     ◉ Problem setup: Volume between two curves around the 𝒚-axis.
          ○  𝓥 = ∫[𝓪, 𝓫] 2π⋅𝒙⋅[𝒇_upper(𝒙) − 𝒇_lower(𝒙)]⋅d𝒙
     ◉ Integration limits: 
          ○ 𝒙 = 𝒙²
          ○ 𝒙 = 0 and 𝒙 = 1
     ◉ Identifying the "Top" Function
          ○ 𝒙:1/2 ⇢ 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙 is on top
     ◉ Integration: ∫[0,1] 2π𝒙 (𝒙 - 𝒙²)⋅d𝒙
     ◉ Simplification: 2π ∫[0,1] (𝒙² - 𝒙³)⋅d𝒙
     ◉ Integration: 2π [(𝒙³/3) - (𝒙⁴/4)] | [0,1]
     ◉ Evaluating limits: 2π [(1/3) - (1/4)]
     ◉ Final result: Volume = π/6.
     
● [36:25]. 🧩 Example – : Region bounded by 𝒇(𝒚) = - 𝒚² + 6𝒚  and  𝓰(𝒚) = 0, around the 𝒙-axis = - 𝒚² + 6𝒚  and  𝓰(𝒚) = 0, around the 𝒙-axis.png)
     ◉ Problem setup: Volume between two curves around the 𝒙-axis.
          ○ 𝓥 = ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 2π·𝒚·[𝒇_right(𝒚) − 𝒇_left(𝒚)]·𝒅𝒚
     ◉ Identifying the "Right" Function
          ○ 𝓰(𝒚) = 0 → 𝒙 = 0 ⇢ verticl line at 𝒙 = 0
          ○ 𝒇_right(𝒚) = - 𝒚² + 6𝒚
     ◉ Integration limits:
          ○ - 𝒚² + 6𝒚 = 0 
          ○ 𝒚 = 0; 𝒚 =6
     ◉ Integration:  
         𝓥  = ∫[0,6] 2π⋅𝒚⋅(-𝒚² + 6𝒚 - 0)⋅d𝒚; 
         𝓥  = 2π ∫[0,6] (-𝒚³ + 6𝒚²)⋅d𝒚; 
     ◉ Evaluating limits:  𝓥  = 2π [ -𝒚⁴/4 + 6𝒚³/3 ] | [0,6];
         𝓥  = 2π [ (-6⁴/4) + 2⋅6³ - 0 ]  = 2π [ -1296/4 + 432 ]  = 216π

● [45:00]. 🧩 Example – cylindrical shells method: Region bounded by 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙² + 1,  𝓰(𝒙) = -𝒙 + 1 and  𝒙 = 𝒉(𝒚) = 1 , around the 𝒚-axis = 𝒙² + 1,  𝓰(𝒙) = -𝒙 + 1 and 𝒉(𝒙) = 1 , around the 𝒚-axis.png)
     ◉ Problem Definition
          ○ The goal is to find the volume of the solid generated by **rotating the region bounded** by three functions around the **𝒚-axis**.
          ○ Given functions:
          ○ 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙² + 1     → Parabola shifted 1 unit up
          ○ 𝓰(𝒙) = -𝒙 + 1     → Straight line with positive slope
          ○ 𝒉(𝒙) = 1            → Vertical boundary of the region
          ○ The region to be rotated is in the first quadrant
     ◉ Considered Integration Methods
          ○ Disk/Washer Method:
               ■ Requires solving the functions in terms of y.
               ■ More complicated due to different limits.
               ■ Two integrals would be needed to compute the volume due to the presence of two distinct functions.
          ○ Cylindrical Shells Method  (preferred):
               ■ Allows working in terms of 𝒙, making integration easier.
               ■ Observes that in each 𝒙, one function is "on top" of the other.
     ◉ Cylindrical Shells Method Setup
          ○ General formula for the cylindrical shells method:
               ■ 𝓥= ∫[𝓪, 𝓫] 2π ⋅ (radius) ⋅ (height)⋅d𝒙
          ○ Radius: The distance from the rotation axis (𝒚-axis) to the differential element in terms of 𝒙.
               ■ Radius = 𝒙
          ○ Height: Difference between the upper and lower functions.
               ■ Height = (𝒙² + 1) - (-𝒙 + 1)
          ○ Integration occurs from 𝒙 = 0 to 𝒙 = 1, as the region is bounded in this interval.
          ○ Setting up the integral for volume:
               ■ 𝓥 = ∫[0, 1] 2π ⋅ 𝒙 ⋅ [(𝒙² + 1) - (-𝒙 + 1)]⋅d𝒙
          ○ Simplifying the expression:
               ■ 𝓥 = ∫[0, 1] 2π ⋅ 𝒙 ⋅ (𝒙² - 𝒙)⋅d𝒙
          ○ Solving the integral:   2π ∫[0, 1] (𝒙³ + 𝒙²)⋅d𝒙  → 2π [ (𝒙⁴ / 4) +(x³ / 3) ] | ₀¹  → 2π (1/4 + 1/3)
          ○ Evaluating the limits:  2π (3/12 + 4/12) = 2π (7/12) =  7π/ 6
     ◉ [45:00]. 🧩 Example –  Disk/Washer Method: Region bounded by 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙² + 1,  𝓰(𝒙) = -𝒙 + 1 and  𝒙 = 𝒉(𝒚) = 1 , around the 𝒚-axis
          ○ Picture & plan
               ■ Axis: 𝒚-axis ⇒ cross-sections ⟂ to 𝒚 ⇒ **washers** in 𝒅𝒚.
               ■ Horizontal slice at height 𝑦 spans from a **left boundary** 𝒙_left(𝑦) to the **right wall** 𝒙 = 1.
          ○ Express 𝒙 in terms of 𝑦 (for horizontal radii)
               ■ From 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙²+1:  𝑦 = 𝒙²+1 ⇒ 𝒙 = ±√(𝑦−1)  (take +√ branch for 𝑦 ≥ 1)
               ■ From 𝓰(𝒙) = −𝒙+1:  𝑦 = −𝒙+1 ⇒ 𝒙 = 1−𝑦
          ○ 𝑦-interval and piecewise left boundary
               ■ Intersections 𝒙²+1=−𝒙+1 ⇒ 𝒙(𝒙+1)=0   ⇒   ✳️(𝒙,𝑦) = (0,1) and (−1,2).
               ■ Intersections with the vertical wall 𝒙=1:
                    ▣ With 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙²+1:  at 𝒙=1 ⇒ 𝒚 = 2 → point (1,2)
                    ▣ With 𝓰(𝒙) = −𝒙+1:  at 𝒙=1 ⇒ 𝒚 = 0 → point (1,0)
                    ▣ Therefore, 𝒙 = 1 spans vertically from 𝒚=0 (line) up to 𝒚 = 2 (parabola)
                    ▣ Both curves intersect at ✳️(0,1), which is exactly where the region changes its left boundary
               ■ Piecewise left boundary (split at 𝒚 = 1):
                    ▣ For 𝒚∈[0,1]: left boundary given by the line ⇒ 𝒙_left(𝑦) = 1−𝑦
                         ▢ Reason: the parabola 𝒚 = 𝒙²+1 starts at 𝒚 = 1 (no real 𝒙 for 𝒚 < 1)
                    ▣ For 𝒚∈[1,2]: left boundary given by the parabola ⇒ 𝒙_left(𝑦) = √(𝑦−1)
                         ▢ Check: at 𝒚 = 1 both meet at (0,1); for 𝒚 > 1, 1−𝒚 < 0 (left of 𝒚-axis) while √(𝑦−1) ≥ 0
          ○ Radii w.r.t. the 𝒚-axis (𝒙 = 0)
               ■ Outer radius 𝑹(𝑦)= distance to 𝒙 = 1 ⇒ 𝑹(𝑦) = 1   (for all 𝑦 in the region)
               ■ Inner radius 𝑟(𝑦)= distance to 𝒙_left(𝑦) ⇒ 𝑟(𝑦) = 𝒙_left(𝑦)
                    ▣ 𝑟(𝑦) = 1−𝑦 for 𝑦∈[0,1];   𝑟(𝑦) = √(𝑦−1) for 𝑦∈[1,2]
          ○ Set up the washer integrals
               ■ 𝓥 = π∫[0,1] (1−(1−𝑦)²)·𝒅𝑦  +  π∫[1,2] (1−(√(𝑦−1))²)·𝒅𝑦
                    ▣ First piece: 2𝑦−𝑦²
                    ▣ Second piece: 2−𝑦
          ○ Evaluate
               ■ I₁ = ∫[0,1] (2𝑦−𝑦²)·𝒅𝑦 = [𝑦² − 𝑦³/3] | [0,1] = 1 − 1/3 = 2/3
               ■ I₂ = ∫[1,2] (2−𝑦)·𝒅𝑦   = [2𝑦 − 𝑦²/2] | [1,2] = (4−2) − (2−1/2) = 1/2
               ■ 𝓥 = π(I₁+I₂) = π(2/3 + 1/2) = 7π/6
