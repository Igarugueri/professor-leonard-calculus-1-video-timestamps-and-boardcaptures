● [0:41]. Presentation of the scenario: Is it possible to derive the product of two functions?
      ◉ [0:52]. 🧩 Example – with basic functions: 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙² and 𝓰(𝒙) = 𝒙³.
           ○ Posing the main question: Is 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙)] = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙)] ⋅ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝓰(𝒙)]?
      ◉ [1:47]. Analysis of the question through the given Example.
           ○ It is observed that 𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙) = 𝒙⁵.
                ■ Calculating 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 (𝒙⁵) = 5𝒙⁴.
           ○ Calculating separately 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙)] ⋅ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝓰(𝒙)].
                ■ A different answer is obtained: 6𝒙³.
           ○ Conclusion: Derivatives cannot be separated by multiplication.
          
● [4:48]. Need for a rule to derive products of functions.
      ◉ [5:00]. Introduction to the concept of the product rule.
     
● [5:21]. Explanation of the product rule.
      ◉ [6:05]. Interpretation in words of the product rule.
      ◉ **Formula of the product rule**: 
           ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙)] = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙)] ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙) + 𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝓰(𝒙)].
          
● [7:13]. Verification of the product rule using the initial Example.
     ◉ Emphasis on the importance of the notation 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 to indicate the function to be derived.
           ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙) · 𝓰(𝒙)] = 𝒇′(𝒙) · 𝓰(𝒙) + 𝒇(𝒙) · 𝓰′(𝒙)
           ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒙² · 𝒙³] = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒙²] · 𝒙³ + 𝒙² · 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒙³]
           ○ 2𝒙 · 𝒙³ + 𝒙² · 3𝒙²
           ○ 2𝒙⁴ + 3𝒙⁴ = 𝟓𝒙⁴
     ◉ Mention of the need for a formal proof to generalize the rule.

● [10:34]. Presentation of an example where distribution is possible.
     ◉ 🧩 Example –: (𝒙² - 1)⋅(3𝒙⁴ - 2𝒙)
          ○ [11:09]. Anticipation of scenarios where distribution will n̲o̲t̲ be feasible.
               ■ [11:23]. 🧩 Example – with a high exponent, where distribution would be tedious.
                    ▣ (𝒙² - 1)⋅(3𝒙⁴ - 2𝒙)⁴
                    ▣ **This is why the project rule become very important**
          ○ [12:19]. 🧩 Example – A Constant in the Product Rule
               ■ Why is the product rule not used here? Because the constant's derivative is zero, so it contributes nothing.
          ○ [14:10]. Two ways to solve 𝐲' from  𝐲 = (𝒙² - 1)(3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙)
               ■ Applying distribution
                    ▣ Expand:
                         ▢ 𝐲 = 3𝒙⁶ + 2𝒙³ - 3𝒙⁴ - 2𝒙
                         ▢ 𝐲 = 3𝒙⁶ - 3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙³ - 2𝒙
                    ▣ Derivative (power rule):
                         ▢ 𝒅𝐲/𝒅𝒙 = 18𝒙⁵ - 12𝒙³ + 6𝒙² - 2
               ■ [15:15]. Applying the product rule Given:

                              ▲ 𝒅𝐲/𝒅𝒙 = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙[(𝒙² - 1)(3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙)] = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙[𝒙² - 1] · (3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙) + (𝒙² - 1) · 𝒅/𝒅𝒙[3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙]
                         ▢ Differentiate each part:
                              ▲ = (2𝒙)(3𝒙⁴ + 2𝒙) + (𝒙² - 1)(12𝒙³ + 2)
                         ▢ Expand both products:
                              ▲ = 6𝒙⁵ + 4𝒙² + 12𝒙⁵ + 2𝒙² - 12𝒙³ - 2
                         ▢ Combine like terms:

● [19:36]. You need to understand the product rule first because it's one of the fundamental tools for differentiating expressions 
               where two functions are multiplied: [(𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙))]' = 𝒇′(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙) + 𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰′(𝒙).
               Later on, you'll often encounter problems where this rule appears **in combination** with the chain rule:  [(𝒇(𝓰(𝒙)))]' = 𝒇′(𝓰(𝒙)) ⋅ 𝓰′(𝒙)
               or with the quotient rule: [(𝒇(𝒙)/𝓰(𝒙))]' = (𝒇′(𝒙)·𝓰(𝒙) – 𝒇(𝒙)·𝓰′(𝒙)) / (𝓰(𝒙))².
               Understanding the product rule early will make it easier to handle these more complex derivative rules as they often work together.
                  
● [20:10]. 🧩 Example – :(𝒙² + 1)⋅√𝒙
     ◉ Apply the product rule:
        ○ 𝒇′(𝒙) = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [1 + 𝒙²]·𝒙¹ᐟ² + (1 + 𝒙²)·𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒙¹ᐟ²]
      ○ 𝒇′(𝒙) = 2𝒙·𝒙¹ᐟ² + (1 + 𝒙²)·(½)·𝒙⁻¹ᐟ²
     ◉ Distribute:
      ○ 𝒇′(𝒙) = 2𝒙·𝒙¹ᐟ² + ½·𝒙⁻¹ᐟ² + ½·𝒙²·𝒙⁻¹ᐟ²
      ○ 𝒇′(𝒙) = 2·𝒙³ᐟ² + ½·𝒙⁻¹ᐟ² + ½·𝒙³ᐟ²
      ○ 𝒇′(𝒙) = (5⁄2)·𝒙³ᐟ² + ½·𝒙⁻¹ᐟ²
      
● [32:10]. 🧩 Example – :Find 𝗀'(2) ; 𝓰(𝒙) = (𝒙² + 1)⋅𝒇(𝒙) ewhere 𝒇(2) = 3  and 𝒇'(2) = 1
     ◉Apply the product rule:
          ○ 𝓰′(𝒙) = 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [(𝒙² + 1)]·𝒇(𝒙) + (𝒙² + 1)·𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙)]
          ○ 𝓰′(𝒙) = 2𝒙·𝒇(𝒙) + (𝒙² + 1)·𝒇′(𝒙)
     ◉ Substitute 𝒙 = 2:
          ○ 𝒈′(2) = 2·2·𝒇(2) + (2² + 1)·𝒇′(2)
          ○ 𝒈′(2) = 4·3 + 5·(–1)
          ○ 𝒈′(2) = 12 – 5 = 7

           ○ Likewise  𝒅/𝒅𝒙 [𝒇(𝒙) / 𝓰(𝒙)] = [𝒇'(𝒙) ⋅ 𝓰(𝒙)    -  𝒇(𝒙) ⋅ 𝗀'(𝒙)]  /  [𝓰(𝒙)]²

      ◉ An example where the quotient rule is necessary.
      ◉ [46:10]. Comparison with a case where prior simplification is possible.
           ○ 𝑦 = (𝒙³ - 3𝒙² - 5) / 2𝒙 
               ■ Iinstead of directly using the quotient rule, you can split the fraction into simpler parts, combine 
                     exponents,  and differentiate each piece separatel.
     ◉ [48:00]. Explanation of how to set up the quotient rule for the given example.
          ○ Apply the quotient rule:
               ■ 𝒅𝑦/𝒅𝒙 = [(2𝒙 + 5) · 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 (𝒙³ − 3𝒙² − 5) − (𝒙³ − 3𝒙² − 5) · 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 (2𝒙 + 5)] / (2𝒙 + 5)²
         ○ Calculate derivatives:
               ■ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 (𝒙³ − 3𝒙² − 5) = 3𝒙² − 6𝒙
               ■ 𝒅/𝒅𝒙 (2𝒙 + 5) = 2
        ○ Substitute and expand:
               ■ Numerator:  (2𝒙 + 5)(3𝒙² − 6𝒙) − (𝒙³ − 3𝒙² − 5)·2
               ■ Denominator: (2𝒙 + 5)²
        ○ Expand the numerator:
               ■ 6𝒙³ − 12𝒙² + 15𝒙² − 30𝒙 − 2𝒙³ + 6𝒙² + 10
        ○ Simplify:
               ■ 4𝒙³ + 9𝒙² − 30𝒙 + 10
        ○ Final answer:
               ■ 𝒅𝑦/𝒅𝒙 = [4𝒙³ + 9𝒙² − 30𝒙 + 10] / (2𝒙 + 5)²
        ○ Emphasis on the importance of using parentheses for correct distribution.
