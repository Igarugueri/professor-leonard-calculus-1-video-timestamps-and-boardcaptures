          ○ Evaluate at the bounds:  
               ■ 𝒙²/2 ∣ [1,5] = (5²)/2 − (1²)/2 = 25/2 − 1/2 = 24/2 = 12

          ○ Rewrite with exponents:
               ■ √𝒙 = 𝒙¹ᐟ²  ⇒  𝒙²·√𝒙 = 𝒙²·𝒙¹ᐟ² = 𝒙⁵ᐟ²
          ○ Antiderivative::
               ■  𝓕(𝒙) = ∫ 𝒙⁵ᐟ² · 𝒅𝒙 = 𝒙⁷ᐟ² ÷ (7/2)= (2/7)·𝒙⁷ᐟ²
          ○ Evaluate at bounds:

               ■ (2/7)·9⁷ᐟ² − (2/7)·4⁷ᐟ²
          ○ Powers and roots:

               ■  tan(𝒙) ∣ [0,π/3] = tan(π/3) − tan(0) = √3 − 0 = √3
     ◉ [25:40]. 🧩 Example – 5: Definite integral with reversed limits ∫[0,4] 𝒙³ · 𝒅𝑥
          ○ Apply 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎  4.4.2: Reversing the limits of integration changes the sign of the integral.
               ■ ∫[𝓫,𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙 = −∫[𝓪,𝓫] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙

     ◉ [28:25]. 🧩 Example – 6: ∫[1, -1] (1/𝒙²) ·𝒅𝑥 ·𝒅𝑥_1.png) ·𝒅𝑥_2.png) 
          ○ Rewrite the integrand with negative exponent:
               ■ 𝒙⁻² = 1/𝒙²
          ○ Apply the power rule:
               ■ ∫ 𝒙⁻² · 𝒅𝑥 = 𝒙⁻¹ / (−1) = −1/𝒙
          ○ Evaluate the definite integral:
               ■ [−1/𝒙]∣[0-1,1] = (−1/1) − (−1/−1) = −1 − 1 = −2 ❓
          ○ Analysis of the Result
               ■ This result suggests a **negative area**, which raises concerns because the function 𝒇(𝒙) = 1/𝒙² is **always positive** on its domain. According to:
                    ▣ 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎  4.4.6: If the function is positive, the integral is positive (and vice versa).
                         ▢ If𝒇(𝒙) ≥ 0 for all 𝒙 ∈ [𝓪,𝓫] then ∫[𝓪,𝓫]𝒇(𝒙) · 𝒅𝑥  ≥ 0
                              ▲ If 𝒇(𝒙) is above the 𝒙-axis, the integral is positive
                         ▢ If𝒇(𝒙) ≤ 0 for all 𝒙 ∈ [𝓪,𝓫] then ∫[𝓪,𝓫]𝒇(𝒙) · 𝒅𝑥  ≤ 0
                              ▲ If 𝒇(𝒙) is below the 𝒙-axis, the integral is negative
               ■ So how can the integral be negative, if the function is positive? The issue lies in the **discontinuity** at 𝒙 = 0.
                    ▣ Discontinuity and Asymptote
                         ▢ The function 𝒇(𝒙) = 1/𝒙² is **undefined at 𝒙 = 0**, and has a **vertical asymptote** there.  
                              ▲ Therefore, the interval [−1, 1] includes a point of discontinuity.  
                         ▢ This means the integral is not proper and **must be treated as an improper integral**, using limits.
                              ▲ The function is unbounded and discontinuous at 𝒙 = 0, leading to an asymptote.
                         ▢ [33:00]. Graphical interpretation showing how the asymptote affects the area.
                              ▲**Observation:** If, because of the asymptote, some of those rectangles blow up to infinity, then the area can’t be computed.
                         ▢ Domain issue: When an asymptote lies within or at the limit of integration, the integral 
                             may diverge or require special treatment (e.g., improper integrals).
                              ▲**Observation:** If the integrand has a vertical asymptote that makes some Riemann rectangles unbounded, the corresponding
                                   improper integral diverges; therefore, the area is not defined.
          ○ NOTE: 🛡️ Pre-check: Domain & Continuity of the Integrand
               ■ Before applying any property (like 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎  4.4.6), **you must verify that the integrand 𝒇(𝒙) is continuous on the interval** [𝓪,𝓫].
                    ▣ If 𝒇(𝒙) is **not defined or not continuous** at any point in [𝓪,𝓫], the integral becomes **improper**.
                    ▣ For improper integrals, **standard properties of definite integrals do not necessarily apply**.
                    ▣  In particular, **you cannot directly say that a positive function implies a positive integral** unless the function is continuous throughout the interval.
               ■ **Think about it:**
                                                    **Checklist before integrating:**
                                                1. 📌 Is 𝒇(𝒙) defined at every point in [𝓪,𝓫]?
                                                2. 📌 Is 𝒇(𝒙) continuous on [𝓪,𝓫]?
                    ▣  If **yes**, proceed with Fundamental Theorem & integral properties.
                    ▣ If **no**, analyze the integral as **improper** (i.e., split it or use limits).
     ◉ [37:23]. 🧩 Example – 7: Integrals with piecewise-defined functions
          ○ ∫[0,6] 𝒇(𝒙) ·𝒅𝑥,  𝒇(𝒙) =  {
                                                      𝒙³      , 𝒙 < 2  
                                                      5𝒙 - 1  , 𝒙 ≥ 2
                                                  }
          ○ Splitting the integral over intervals where the function is defined
              ■ Continuity is required to split the integral properly
          ○ Computing each integral separately:
           ■ ∫[0,2] 𝒙³·𝒅𝒙 = 𝒙⁴∕4 evaluated from 0 to 2 → 2⁴∕4 − 0 = 16∕4 = 4  
      ■ ∫[2,6] (5𝒙−1)·𝒅𝒙 =  
                        = ∫ 5𝒙·𝒅𝒙 = (5𝒙²)/2  
                        = ∫ (−1)·𝒅𝒙 = −𝒙  
                        = [5·6²∕2 − 6] − [5·2²∕2 − 2] = [90−6] − [10−2] = 84 − 8 = 76  
    ■ Total area: 4 + 76 = 80
          ○ **What happens at 𝒙 = 2?**
               ■ At 𝒙 = 2, the function is **discontinuous** (it jumps from one branch to another).  
               ■ Therefore, it is **not differentiable** at that point.  
               ■ **Result:**  There is **no single, continuous antiderivative** on the entire interval [0,6].
          ○ **Can we apply the FTC directly to ∫[0,6] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙?**
               ■ **No.**  
               ■ The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus – Part II** (the evaluation part) requires that:
                   1. 𝒇(𝒙) is **continuous over** [𝓪,𝓫]  
                   2. There exists a function 𝓕 such that 𝓕′(𝒙) = 𝒇(𝒙)
               ■ In this case, these conditions **are not met** because:
                    ▣ 𝒇(𝒙) is **not continuous at** 𝒙 = 2  
                    ▣ There is **no single function** 𝓕 that differentiates to 𝒇 over [0,6]
          ○ **What should we do instead?**
               ■ Split the interval into parts where the function is continuous:
                    ▣ ∫[0,6] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙 = ∫[0,2] 𝒙³·𝒅𝒙 + ∫[2,6] (5𝒙 − 1)·𝒅𝒙
                    ▣ On each subinterval:
                         ▢ 𝒇(𝒙) is **continuous**  
                         ▢ We can apply **FTC Part II**  
                         ▢ We compute the area using the appropriate antiderivative for each part
          ○ **Think about it:** 
               ■ **Core Idea:** If the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus **cannot be applied directly** because of a **discontinuity inside the interval**,  
                **split the integral into continuous sections**  and apply the theorem to each one **individually**.
          ○ [38:40]. ❌ if 5𝒙 - 1,    𝒙 > 2, the function 𝒇(𝒙) is **not defined** at 𝒙=2 in the given statement.
               ■ This is a problem because in order to split the definite integral at 𝒙 = 2, the function must be defined at that point.  
     ■ Since 𝒇(𝒙) omits the value at 𝒙 = 2, the expression ∫[0,6] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙 is not properly defined as a standard definite integral.  
     ■ To fix this, the piecewise function must include a definition for 𝒙 = 2, either from the left or the right.

     ◉ Step 1: Find zeros of 𝒇(𝒙) = 0

  ◉ Step 2: Create a sign analysis using these roots (those which are within the integration interval) and the interval limits

  ◉ Step 3: Determine where 𝒇(𝒙) is positive or negative

        = ∫[0,1] (1 − 𝒙²)·𝒅𝒙 − ∫[1,2] (1 − 𝒙²)·𝒅𝒙  
 ◉ Step 5: Integrate and evaluate each interval

      ∫[0,1] (1 − 𝒙²)·𝒅𝒙 = [𝒙 − 𝒙³/3] ∣ [0,1]  
        = (1 − 1/3) − (0 − 0) = 2/3  
     ○ Second integral:  
      ∫[1,2] (1 − 𝒙²)·𝒅𝒙 = [𝒙 − 𝒙³/3] ∣ [1,2]  
        = (2 − 8/3) − (1 − 1/3)  
        = (−2/3) − (2/3) = −4/3  
        → with the minus sign from before: −(−4/3) = +4/3

     ◉ Change the limits to match 𝓾; no resubstitution. 
     ◉ **NO** Back-substitution
     ◉ 🧩 Example – Definite Integral with Substitution (Method 2): ∫[0,2] 4𝒙(𝒙² - 1)³ ·𝒅𝑥
          ○ Substitution:  
                 𝓾 = 𝒙² − 1  
                 𝒅𝓾 = 2𝒙·𝒅𝒙  
                 𝒅𝓾 / 2𝒙 = 𝒅𝒙  
          ○ Change bounds:  
                 If 𝒙 = 2 → 𝓾 = 2² − 1 = 3  
                 If 𝒙 = 0 → 𝓾 = 0² − 1 = −1  
          ○ Rewrite integral:  
                ∫[0,2] 4𝒙·(𝒙² − 1)³·𝒅𝒙  
                = ∫[−1,3] 2·𝓾³·𝒅𝓾  
                = 2 ∫[−1,3] 𝓾³·𝒅𝓾  
          ○ Integration:  
                ∫ 𝓾³·𝒅𝓾 = 𝓾⁴/4  
               → 2·(𝓾⁴/4) = 𝓾⁴/2  
          ○ Evaluate:  
                [ 𝓾⁴/2 ]∣[−1,3]  
               = (3⁴ / 2) − ((−1)⁴ / 2)  
               = (81/2) − (1/2)  
               = 40  
          ○ **Conclusion:**  
               ■ By changing the bounds to match the substitution,  
                    ▣ there is **no need to back-substitute** into 𝒙.

     ◉ ∫[0, 7π/8] [sin(2𝒙)]⁵· cos(2𝒙) · 𝒅𝑥
          ○ The integral is rewritten in the form [𝓰(𝒙)]ⁿ · 𝓰′(𝒙), which is exactly the pattern for applying the reverse chain rule (substitution).
     ◉ 𝓾 = sin(2𝒙)
          ○ 𝒅𝓾 = 2cos(2𝒙)·𝒅𝒙  ⟹  𝒅𝒙 = 𝒅𝓾 / (2cos(2𝒙))
     ◉ [1:51:02]. Converting original 𝒙-limits into new 𝓾-limits
          ○ 𝒙 = 0 ⟹ 𝓾 = sin(0) = 0  
          ○ 𝒙 = 7π/8 ⟹ 𝓾 = sin(2π/8) = (√2) / 2
     ◉ Substituting and integrating

     ◉ Substitution: 𝓾 = 𝒙 - 3, so that: 𝒅𝓾 = 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ The integration limits change:
          ○ When 𝒙 = 2 → 𝓾 = 2 - 3 = -1
          ○ When 𝒙 = 5 → 𝓾 = 5 - 3 = 2
     ◉ Rewriting 2𝒙 - 5 in terms of 𝓾:
          ○ Since 𝒙 = 𝓾 + 3, then:  2𝒙 - 5 = 2(𝓾 + 3) - 5 = 2𝓾 + 6 - 5 = 2𝓾 + 1
     ◉ Substituting into the integral:  
          ∫[-1, 2] (2𝓾 + 1)·𝓾⁹·𝒅𝓾
             = ∫[-1, 2] (2𝓾¹⁰ + 𝓾⁹)·𝒅𝓾
             = [ (2𝓾¹¹)/11 + (𝓾¹⁰)/10 ] ∣ [-1,2]
     ◉ Evaluation:
          = ( (2·2¹¹)/11 + (2¹⁰)/10 ) − ( (2·(−1)¹¹)/11 + ((−1)¹⁰)/10 )  
          = ( 4096/11 + 1024/10 ) − ( −2/11 + 1/10 )  
          = 4096/11 + 1024/10 + 2/11 − 1/10  
          = 4098/11 + 1023/10

     ◉ Substitution: 𝓾 = π/𝒙; 𝒅𝓾 = -π𝒙⁻² · 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ Changing the limits:
          ○ 𝒙 = 3 → 𝓾 = π/3
          ○ 𝒙 = 1 → 𝓾 = π
     ◉ Rewriting the integral:
          ○ ∫[π/3, π] cos(𝓾) · (-π/𝒙²) · 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ Substituting 𝒅𝑥:
          ○ ∫[π/3, π] cos(𝓾) · (-1/π) · 𝒅𝓾
     ◉ Applying the  𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎 4.4.2 (indefinite interaks) of sign change in limits:

               ■ ∫[𝓫,𝓪]𝒇(𝒙) 𝒅𝑥 = - ∫[𝓪,𝓫]𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥

     ◉ 𝒇(-𝒙) = 𝒇(𝒙), showing symmetry about the y-axis
     ◉ Symmetry: The function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, which means that if we reflect any point on the
         graph over the vertical axis (y-axis), we obtain another point that also belongs to the graph.

          ○ Step 1: Identify symmetry
               ■ 𝒇(−𝒙) = (−𝒙)² + 4 = 𝒙² + 4 = 𝒇(𝒙) → 𝒇 is **even**
          ○ Step 2: Apply property of even functions
               ■ ∫[−𝓪, 𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥 = 2∫[0, 𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥

     ◉ 𝒇(-𝒙) = -𝒇(𝒙), showing symmetry about the origin.
     ◉ Symmetry: The function exhibits symmetry with respect to the origin, which means that if we rotate any 
         point on the graph 180 degrees around the origin (switching the signs of both coordinates), we obtain another point that 
         also belongs to the graph.
     ◉ 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎 4.5.2  of integrating an odd function over [-a, a]
          ○ If 𝒇(𝒙) is odd: ∫[-a, a] 𝒇(𝒙)∙𝒅𝑥 = 0
     ◉ [2:42:10] 🧩 Example – odd function: [-3, 3] sin(𝒙)  /  √(1 + 𝒙²) ·𝒅𝑥  ∕  √(1 + 𝒙²) ·𝒅𝑥.png)
          ○ Step 1: Define the function
               ■ 𝒇(𝒙) = sin(𝒙) / √(1 + 𝒙²)
          ○ Step 2: Test odd/even symmetry
               ■ 𝒇(−𝒙) = sin(−𝒙) / √(1 + (−𝒙)²) 
                        = (−sin(𝒙)) / √(1 + 𝒙²) 
                        = −𝒇(𝒙)
               ■ Therefore, 𝒇(𝒙) is **odd**.
          ○ Step 3: Apply 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎 4.5.2 of odd functions
               ■ For any odd function, the areas on symmetric intervals [−𝓪,0] and [0,𝓪] cancel out:
                    ▣ From 𝒫𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓉𝓎 4.4.5 of definite integrals:
                         ▢ ∫[−𝓪, 𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥 = ∫[−𝓪, 0] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥 + ∫[0, 𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥
                    ▣ Since 𝒇(−𝒙) = −𝒇(𝒙), the negative side is the exact opposite of the positive side.
                    ▣ Thus, the two contributions cancel each other out.
               ■ Conclusion: ∫[−𝓪, 𝓪] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝑥 = 0
