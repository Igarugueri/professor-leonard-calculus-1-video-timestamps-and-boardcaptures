● [00:01]. Introduction 
     ◉ Presentation of the topic: Functions (Section 0.2)
          ○ Initial definition of a function: one variable depends on another (e.g., 𝒚 depends on 𝒙)
          ○ Fundamental condition for a function: each input has exactly one output
               ■ If one input had multiple outputs, it would not be a function
          ○ Common notation for inputs (𝒙) and outputs (𝒚 or 𝒇(𝒙))
          ○ Ways to represent functions
               ■ Tables
                    ▣ [02:00]. 🧩 Example – Function table: Fish caught and their weight
                         ▢ Clarification about having specific outputs for each input
                         ▢ It is allowed for different inputs to share the same output
                    ▣ [05:25]. Reference table for a function:
                         x | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3
                         y | 2 | 5 | -3 | 9
                    ▣ [05:50]. Reference table for not a function.
                         x | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3 | 2
                         y | 2 | 5 | -3 | 9 | 7
                    ▣ [07:05].🧩 Example –: if 𝒚 = 𝒇(𝒙), find 𝒇(0)
                         ▢ Reference table for examples:
                              x | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3
                               y | 2 | 5 | -3 | 9
                         ▢ Interpreting 𝒇(0) as the output when the input is 0
                              ▲ 𝒇(0) = 2
                         ▢ Another example: find 𝒇(3)
                              ▲ 𝒇(3) = 9

● [07:05]. Typical application with equations (e.g., 𝒚 = 3𝒙² - 4𝒙 + 2) 
     ◉ Isn't the best way to represent a function because when we are looking at to different functions at once we are not oing to
         distinguish between them.
         
● [08:24]. Advantages of using 𝒇(𝒙), 𝓰(𝒙), 𝒉(𝒙)
      ◉ Helps distinguish between multiple functions
      ◉ 🧩 Example –: Find 𝒇(0) for 𝒇(𝒙) = 3𝒙² - 4𝒙 + 2
      ◉ Contrast 𝒇(0) = 2  with 𝒚 = 2
           ○ 𝒇(0) inherently shows the value of the input
           ○ We obtain also a coordinate point (0,2)
                ■ Coordinate points expressed as (𝒙, 𝒇(𝒙))

● [09:40]. The Vertical Line Test 
     ◉ Reminder: in tables, repeated inputs with different outputs mean it is not a function
     ◉ Explanation of the Vertical Line Test
          ○ A graph is a function if and only if every vertical line intersects it at most once
     ◉ Graphic examples
          ○ A diagonal line: it is a function
          ○ A parabola: it is a function (though not one-to-one)
          ○ A graph that passes the test even if it has an empty section (e.g., 1/𝒙)
               ■ Not every input must have an output, but if it does, it must be unique
          ○ A graph that fails the Vertical Line Test (one input with multiple outputs) is not a function   

● [13:20]. 🧩 Example – Equation that does not represent a function: the circle 
     ◉ Equation of a circle centered at the origin: 𝒙² + 𝒚² = 25
     ◉ When trying to solve for 𝒚, we get 𝒚 = ±√(25 - 𝒙²)
     ◉ The ± indicates one input (x) can have two different outputs (y), so it is not a function
     ◉ However, parts of the circle can be functions if defined separately
          ○ 𝒇(𝒙) = √(25 - 𝒙²) (the upper half)
          ○ 𝓰(𝒙) = -√(25 - 𝒙²) (the lower half)

● [17:40]. General idea 
     ◉ The function’s formula depends on the value of 𝒙
          ○ The function changes depending on the imput value
          
● [19:10]. Defining absolute value as an example of a piecewise function 
     ◉ The absolute value symbol: |𝒙|
     ◉ Intuitive definition: distance from zero
     ◉ More specific two-part definition:
          ○ If 𝒙 is positive (or zero), |𝒙| = 𝒙
          ○ If 𝒙 is negative, |𝒙| = –𝒙 (the sign is flipped)
     🧩 Example – : |5| = 5; |-12| = 12
         
● [20:45]. Formal notation for a piecewise function 
     ◉ Use of braces to group the different definitions and their 𝒙-ranges
     ◉ 🧩 Example of the piecewise definition for absolute value
          
● [23:50]. Graphing piecewise functions 
     ◉ Each “piece” is graphed individually
     ◉ The correct domain interval must be applied to each piece
     ◉ [25:00]. Graphing absolute value function 
     ◉ [27:35]. 🧩 Example – Graphing a piecewise function: 
                                { 𝒇(𝒙) = 0                for   𝒙 ≤ –1;
                                 𝒇(𝒙) = √(1 – 𝒙²)    for   –1 < 𝒙 < 1; 
                                 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙                for 𝒙 ≥ 1 }
          ○ Identifying key intervals where the function’s definition changes
          ○ 𝒇(𝒙) = 0 for 𝒙 ≤ –1
               ■ Graph of 𝒚 = 0 (the x-axis) for 𝒙 ≤ –1
               ■ Closed circle at 𝒙 = –1 because of “≤”
          ○ 𝒇(𝒙) = √(1 – 𝒙²) for –1 < 𝒙 < 1
               ■ Rewriting as 𝒚 = √(1 – 𝒙²)
               ■ Recognizing the related circle equation (𝒙² + 𝒚² = 1)
               ■ Identifying it as the upper semicircle of radius 1, centered at (0, 0)
               ■ Open circles because of the strict inequality “<”
                    ▣  At 𝒙 = –1 and  
                         ▢ Connection to the closed circle from the previous piece at 𝒙 = –1
                    ▣  At 𝒙 = 1
          ○ 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙 for 𝒙 ≥ 1
               ■ Graph of 𝒚 = 𝒙 (a straight line through the origin with slope 1)
               ■ Only consider the portion for 𝒙 ≥ 1
               ■ Closed circle at 𝒙 = 1 due to “≥”
               
● [35:25]. Domain and Range of a function 
     ◉ Definition of Domain
          ○ All values that can be “input” into a function
          ○ Typically 𝒙-values, but can vary depending on the problem’s variables
     ◉ Definition of Range
          ○ All possible values that are “output” by a function
          ○ Typically 𝒚-values or 𝒇(𝒙)
     ◉ Restrictions on the Domain
          ○ Real-world constraints (problem context)
               ■  [36:40].🧩 Example – The area of a square (side 𝓼): 𝓼²
                    ▣ The domain (𝓼) cannot be negative
                    ▣ The side can be zero (trivial area)
          ○ [38:06]. Formula-based restrictions
               ■ Division by zero: the denominator cannot be zero (e.g., 𝒚 = 1/𝒙)
               ■ Even-index roots: the radicand cannot be negative in real numbers (e.g., 𝒇(𝒙) = √𝒙)
                    ▣ The square root of zero is defined
                    ▣ In complex numbers, roots of negative numbers do exist (using i)
     ◉ [39:30]. Natural Domain 
          ○ Definition for this course: all values that work in the formula, including natural and formula-based restrictions
               ■ When we find the natural domain, we must consider (include) any restrictions that naturally arise from the formula — 
                  — these restrictions define which values must be excluded.
          ○ In short: all values for which the formula makes sense
     ◉ [40:54]. How to find the Natural Domain
          ○ 🧩 Example – 1 Natural Domain: 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝒙³  = 𝒙³.png)
               ■ Is there any number you cannot plug in? No
               ■ Domain: all real numbers (𝓡 or 𝒙 ∈ 𝓡)
          ○ [42:21]. 🧩 Example – 2 Natural Domain: 𝒇(𝒙) = (2𝒙 + 1) / ((𝒙 – 1)(𝒙 – 3))  = (2𝒙 + 1) ∕ ((𝒙 – 1)(𝒙 – 3)).png)
               ■ Some numbers make the denominator zero; these are excluded
               ■ Set the denominator (𝒙 – 1)(𝒙 – 3) = 0
                    ▣ Solutions: 𝒙 = 1 and 𝒙 = 3
               ■ Domain: 
                    ▣ Sets:  𝒙 ∈ 𝓡 ∖ {1,3}​
                    ▣ Set-Builder Notation: { 𝓍 ∈ 𝓡 : 𝓍 ≠ 𝟙 and 𝓍 ≠ 𝟑 }
                    ▣ Union of Intervals:  (−∞, 1) ∪ (1, 3) ∪ (3, ∞)
          ○ [45:15]. 🧩 Example – 3 Natural Domain: 𝓰(𝒙) = tan(𝒙)  = tan(𝒙).png)
               ■ Definition of tangent: sin(𝒙)/cos(𝒙)
               ■ Tangent is undefined where cosine is zero
               ■ Cosine is zero at 𝒙 = π/2, 3π/2, –π/2, etc.
               ■ Domain: all real numbers except 𝒙 = π/2 + nπ, where n is an integer
          ○ [48:10]. 🧩 Example – 4 Natural Domain: 𝒇(𝒙) = √(6 – 5𝒙 + 𝒙²)  = √(6 – 5𝒙 + 𝒙²).png)
               ■ Potential problem: the square root of a negative number
               ■ The radicand must be ≥ 0: 6 – 5𝒙 + 𝒙² ≥ 0
               ■ Factorization of the quadratic: (𝒙 – 2)(𝒙 – 3) ≥ 0
               ■ Sign analysis test to find intervals satisfying this inequality
                    ▣ Critical points: 𝒙 = 2 and 𝒙 = 3
                    ▣ Draw a number line with critical points
                    ▣ Test values in each interval
                         ▢ For 𝒙 < 2 (e.g., 0), the product is positive
                         ▢ For 2 < 𝒙 < 3 (e.g., 2.5), the product is negative
                         ▢ For 𝒙 > 3 (e.g., 4), the product is positive
                    ▣ Intervals where the expression is nonnegative form the domain
                         ▢ Domain in interval notation: (–∞, 2] ∪ [3, ∞)
          ○ [58:50]. 🧩 Example – 5 Natural Domain: 𝒇(𝒙) = (𝒙² – 4) / (𝒙 – 2)  = (𝒙² – 4)  ∕ (𝒙 – 2).png)
               ■ Potential problem: denominator is zero if 𝒙 = 2
               ■ Domain:  𝒙 ∈ 𝓡 ∖ {2}
               ■ Simplification: 𝒇(𝒙) = ((𝒙 + 2)(𝒙 – 2)) / (𝒙 – 2) = 𝒙 + 2 (for 𝒙 ≠ 2) 
               ■ Even if the function simplifies, the original domain restriction remains
               ■ The discontinuity at 𝒙 = 2 is called a “hole” or removable discontinuity
                    ▣ Occurs when the problematic factor can be canceled
                    ▣ In polynomials, this happens when substitution yields 0/0
                    ▣ [01:03:14]. Graph
               ■ If the problematic factor cannot be canceled, we get a vertical asymptote
                    ▣ Typically a number/zero form upon substitution
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               ■ [01:06:00]. Removable discontinuity  Vs. Vertical asymptote 
                    ▣ 𝒇(𝒙) = (𝒙² − 4)/(𝒙 − 2)  
                         ▢ Has a “domain problem” at 𝒙 = 2  
                         ▢ But it can be removed, problematic factor can be canceled (this is a removable discontinuity — it creates a "hole")  
                    ▣ 𝓰(𝒙) = 3𝒙/(𝒙 − 4)  
                         ▢ Also has a “domain issue” at 𝒙 = 4  
                         ▢ But it cannot be removed, problematic factor cannot be canceled — it's a vertical asymptote
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ○ [01:10:20]. 🧩 Example – 6: 𝒇(𝒙) = 2 + √(𝒙 – 1)  = 2 + √(𝒙 – 1).png)
               ■ Potential problem: negative radicand
               ■ Inequality: 𝒙 – 1 ≥ 0
               ■ Solution: 𝒙  ≥ 1
               ■ Domain in interval notation: [1,∞)
          ○ [01:13:00]. 🧩 Example – 7: with a root in the denominator: 𝒇(𝒙) = 1 / √(𝒙 – 1)  = 1 ∕ √(𝒙 – 1).png)
               ■ Restrictions: the radicand cannot be negative and the denominator cannot be zero
               ■ Inequality: 𝒙 – 1 > 0
               ■ Solution: 𝒙  > 1
     ◉ [01:13:35]. How to find the Range 
          ○ The set of all possible outputs (𝒚-values)
          ○ 𝓕𝓲𝓻𝓼𝓽 𝓶𝓮𝓽𝓱𝓸𝓭: substitute domain values into the function and observe the results
               ■ [01:15:55]. 🧩 Example – : 𝒇(𝒙) = 2 + √(𝒙 – 1)  with domain [1,∞)
                    ▣ If 𝒙 = 1, 𝒇(1) = 2
                    ▣ As 𝒙 decreases, 𝒇(𝒙) increases toward +∞
                    ▣ Range: [2, ∞)
          ○ 𝓢𝓮𝓬𝓸𝓷𝓭 𝓶𝓮𝓽𝓱𝓸𝓭 (not always easy): solve for 𝒙 in terms of 𝒚 and find that domain of 𝒚
               ■ This makes the outputs act like “inputs”
          ○ [01:16:15]. Range example: 𝒇(𝒙) = (𝒙 + 1) / (𝒙 – 1)  = (𝒙 + 1) ∕ (𝒙 – 1).png)
               ■ Domain: 𝒙 ≠ 1, vertical asymptote (problematic factor cannot be canceled)
               ■ Solve for 𝒙: 
                   𝒚(𝒙 – 1) = 𝒙 + 1  =>  
                   𝒚𝒙 – 𝒚 = 𝒙 + 1  =>  
                   𝒚𝒙 – 𝒙 = 𝒚 + 1  =>  
                   𝒙(𝒚 – 1) = 𝒚 + 1  => 
                   𝒙 = (𝒚 + 1) / (𝒚 – 1)
               ■ The condition 𝒚 ≠ 1 indicates the range excludes 𝒚 = 1 (the domain of 𝒚 is the range of the function)
               ■ That exclusion (𝒚 ≠ 1) corresponds to a horizontal asymptote
               ■ Warning: this method is not always straightforward

● [01:21:25]. 🧩 Example – Application problem: Cardboard box 
     ◉ Problem description: cutting squares out of the corners of a piece of cardboard to form a box
     ◉ Cardboard dimensions: 16 inches by 30 inches
     ◉ The cut squares must have the same side length (𝒙) on each corner
     ◉ Formula for the volume of the box as a function of 𝒙
          ○ Length of the base: 30 – 2𝒙
          ○ Width of the base: 16 – 2𝒙
          ○ Height of the box: 𝒙
          ○ Volume 𝓥(𝒙) = 𝒙(16 – 2𝒙)(30 – 2𝒙)
     ◉ [01:27:05]. Realistic domain for the volume function
          ○ There are no denominators or roots in the volume formula
          ○ Real-world restriction: the length of the cuts (𝒙) must be positive (𝒙 > 0)
          ○ The cut cannot be so large that a side is fully removed
          ○ The maximum cut is less than half of the shorter dimension (16 inches), so 𝒙 < 8
          ○ Realistic domain: 0 < 𝒙 < 8
