● [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wur9Lixb0&t=0). Introduction to finding the area between two curves [📷image](../img/Calculus 1 Lecture 5.1/[00-00]-01.png)
     ◉ General idea: A function 𝒇(𝒙) is above another function 𝓰(𝒙) over an interval [𝓪, 𝓫].
          ○ The area between 𝒇(𝒙) and 𝓰(𝒙) is the area under 𝒇(𝒙) minus the area under 𝓰(𝒙).
               ■ The area between two curves is always non-negative. If you get a negative value, something is wrong (ordering or setup).
     ◉ [03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wur9Lixb0&t=235). Representation with integrals
          ○ **Area under 𝒇(𝒙) minus area under 𝓰(𝒙):**
               ■ ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙 − ∫[𝓪,𝓫] 𝓰(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙
                    ▣ ∫[𝓪,𝓫] (𝒇(𝒙) − 𝓰(𝒙))·𝒅𝒙, assuming 𝒇(𝒙) ≥ 𝓰(𝒙) for all 𝒙 ∈ [𝓪,𝓫]
          ○ [05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wur9Lixb0&t=359). Important note: For the single-integral formula to work, 𝒇(𝒙) ≥ 𝓰(𝒙) on the entire interval [𝓪, 𝓫]
               ■ 𝒇(𝒙) may touch 𝓰(𝒙), but must not go below it on [𝓪,𝓫]
               ■ If the graphs intersect inside (𝓪,𝓫), split at all intersection points and integrate piecewise, keeping the upper–minus–lower order on each subinterval.
          ○ [09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wur9Lixb0&t=588). Relationship with total area [📷image](../img/Calculus 1 Lecture 5.1/[09-48]-01.png)
               ■ Generalization: The “area under a curve” is the area between 𝒇(𝒙) and the 𝒙-axis (𝑦=0).
                    ▣ ∫[𝓪,𝓫] (𝒇(𝒙) − 0)·𝒅𝒙  (here 𝓰(𝒙)=0).
               ■ If 𝒇(𝒙) dips below the 𝒙-axis, use absolute value or split at its zeros:
                    ▣ “Above − below” by splitting at 𝓬 where 𝒇(𝓬)=0:
                         ▢ ∫[𝓪,𝓬] (𝒇(𝒙) − 0)·𝒅𝒙 + ∫[𝓬,𝓫] (0 − 𝒇(𝒙))·𝒅𝒙 =
                             = ∫[𝓪,𝓬] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙 − ∫[𝓬,𝓫] 𝒇(𝒙)·𝒅𝒙
                    ▣ Equivalently, the total area is ∫[𝓪,𝓫] |𝒇(𝒙)|·𝒅𝒙.
               ■ Conclusion: “Area between two curves” and “area under a curve” are the same concept with 𝓰(𝒙)=0 as the baseline.

               ■ Set 𝒇(𝒙) = 𝓰(𝒙).  
               ■ Solve 𝒙² = 𝒙 + 6 ⟹ (𝒙 - 3)(𝒙 + 2) = 0 ⟹ 𝒙 = -2, 𝒙 = 3.

               ■ Test a point (e.g. 𝒙 = 0).  
               ■ 𝒇(0) = 0² = 0, 𝓰(0) = 0 + 6 = 6.  
               ■ Since 𝓰(𝒙) > 𝒇(𝒙), the line 𝒙 + 6 is above the parabola 𝒙².

     ◉ The curves represent each car’s speed as a function of time.
     ◉ The area between the curves represents the distance between the cars.
          ○ The are of each rextangle is 𝓿∙𝓽 = Distance
     ◉ Distance = ∫[𝓪, 𝓫] (Car 1's speed - Car 2's speed)·dt
     ◉ The area shows how far "my" car is ahead of "your" car.
     ◉ If the cars cross paths multiple times, multiple integrals must be set up.
     ◉ The net integral gives the final distance between the cars.

               ■ Vertical slices require splitting; horizontal slices do not.
                    ▣ Riemann view:

               ■ 𝒙 = 𝑦² becomes 𝑦 = ±√𝒙.
               ■ 𝑦 = 𝒙 - 2 remains the same.
                    ▣  Solve for 𝑦: 𝑦² = 𝑦 + 2
                         ▢ ① Obtaining the values 𝑦 = 2 and 𝑦 = -1.
                         ▢ ② Then, substitute these values into the equation 𝒙 = 𝑦² (or 𝒙 = 𝑦 + 2) to find the corresponding 𝒙-values for the integration limits.
                         ▢ ③ Finally, the new limits in terms of 𝒙 will be 𝒙 = 1 and 𝒙 = 4, allowing the integral to be rewritten in terms of 𝒙.

                                              Domain: 𝒙 ≥ 0  
                                              Set equal: √𝒙 = -√𝒙; 2√𝒙 = 0 → √𝒙 = 0 → 𝒙 = 0  
                                              Intersection point: (0, 0)  
                         ▢ The functions √𝒙 and -√𝒙 intersect only at the origin so 𝒙 = 0 is another integration limit.

          ○ Introduction
               ■ **It is easier to integrate with respect to 𝑦** because only two functions are involved,
                   and one is always to the right of the other.
               ■ The formula is similar to integrating with respect to 𝒙, but with 𝒙 and 𝑦 reversed along the 𝑦-axis
                    ▣ Now we have to go from 𝓒 to 𝓓 along the 𝑦-axis over one interval [𝓒, 𝓓]
                    ▣ General idea: A function 𝒇(𝒙) is **on the right** of another function 𝓰(𝒙) over an interval [𝓒, 𝓓]
                         ▢ Note that the right function was the above (top) function on interval [𝓪, 𝓫] when we integrate with respect to 𝒙
               ■ **Set up the equations in terms of 𝑦:** 𝒙 = 𝒉(𝑦), 𝒙 = 𝓰(𝑦).
               ■ [1:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wur9Lixb0&t=5350). The area is ∫[𝓒, 𝓓] (𝒉(𝑦) - 𝓰(𝑦)) ·𝒅𝑦 if 𝒉(𝑦) ≥ 𝓰(𝑦) for all 𝑦 in [𝓒, 𝓓]

          ○ 𝒮𝓉ℯ𝓅 2: Determine the integration limits (the 𝑦-values) and which function is on the right and on the left.
               ■ On the right  𝑦 + 2; on the left  𝑦²
                    ▣ Justify right − left on the whole interval: 𝑦² ≤ 𝑦 + 2 ⇔ (𝑦 − 2)(𝑦 + 1) ≤ 0, true for 𝑦 ∈ [−1,2] ⇒ no split needed.
               ■ Continuity note: both curves are continuous; the region is closed and bounded → area via definite integrals applies directly.
               ■ Domain note (for 𝑦 = ±√𝒙): 𝒙 ≥ 0, which explains the vertical left bound 𝒙 = 0 and the split at 𝒙 = 1.
